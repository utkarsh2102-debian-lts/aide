aide (0.16~b1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES
     Negative selection lines of the form '!<regex> <groups>' are no longer
     supported (use '!<regex>' instead). The affected config files in the
     aide-common package (31_aide_ntp-server, 31_aide_inn2) have been fixed.

     The switch to Perl 5 Compatible Regular Expressions and the fix of
     '.*'-rule matching may result in different rule matching behaviour.

    Apart from that the options report_attributes and ignore_list has been
    deprecated (use report_force_attrs and report_ignore_changed_attrs
    instead).

aide (0.14.2.git20100726-1) unstable; urgency=low

    The important changes since last NEWS entry are:
    - aide is now checking the file type and file attributes on
      a Linux second extended file system
    - the checksum whirlpool has been disabled as it is broken on sparc
      and sparc64
    - the files in the report are now sorted by filename
    - new group definition: VarDirTime
    - new upstream grouped feature to disable the grouping in the report
    - new command 'aide-attributes' (see man page for details)

    Due to the above changes in configuration, you may want to
    update your database (the way you usually do it) to avoid
    thousands of "different attribute" warnings.

aide (0.14~rc3-1) unstable; urgency=low

    In this release, a lot of things have changed. Most changes were
    inspired and done by Hannes von Haugwitz, who has been a real big help
    in preparing the new version of aide, both for Debian and upstream.
    
    The important changes in this release are:
    - added aide.settings.d
      Some rules delivered by the aide distributions can be
      parametrized. These parameters used to be in the rule directory
      itself, but were moved to /etc/aide/aide.settings.d with this
      version of the package. Old parameter files still sitting in the
      rule directory will take precedence, but trigger a warning. You
      may want to review your parameter files and adapt them.
    - /etc/default/aide has new options: TRUNCATEDETAILS, FILTERUPDATES,
      FILTERINSTALLATIONS, LINES=0, UPAC_SETTINGSD. They are
      documented in the file itself.
    - many, many updated and new rules
    - new group definitions: VarTime, VarInode, VarDirInode
    - aide is now checking the target of symbolic links (link name)
    - On systems supporting these features aide is now checking ACLs,
      extended attributes and selinux attributes.
    - The obsolete checksums md5 and sha-1 have been replaced by
      sha256 and sha512.
    - The upstream summarize_changes feature is disabled by default to
      avoid changing the output format, but it may be enabled in a
      future release. We would appreciate testing of the new feature, so if
      you feel like it, please enable it manually in aide.conf 
    - The daily e-mail now includes the log file checksum to detect
      modifications of the log file on the target system.
    
    Due to the numerous changes in configuration, you may want to
    update your database (the way you usually do it) to avoid
    thousands of "different attribute" warnings.

aide (0.13.1-10) unstable; urgency=low

    The aide configuration now sets a macro called YEAR4D to the four
    digit current year, and makes use of that macro in the
    configuration files where a year is included in a file name. This
    means that you do not need to adapt your configuration over the
    new year and still only exclude files that are concerned with the
    current year. However, you'll get a whole bunch of "file changed"
    and "new file" reports on new year. If you don't like to manually
    accept these changes on new year, you can manually set YEAR4D to a
    regexp covering the years you don't want reported.

    In the course of this change, configuration that still acted on
    2006's files only has been fixed. Sheesh.

aide (0.12.20061123-0) unstable; urgency=low

    aide now suports a new hash called whirlpool which is enabled in
    the default config. This means that aide --update|--check is going
    to complain about database entries with different attributes. The
    final aide output will be correct though, so it is advised to update
    your databases after installing this package.

aide (0.11a-4) unstable; urgency=low

    This version has changed the way that the Debian configuration is
    handled with regard to local configurations that might be used to
    have additional, local checks.

    The AIDE binary is /usr/bin/aide again, and the wrapper handling
    locking and special configuration processing is now aide.wrapper.
    The scripts delivered with the Debian package now invoke
    aide.wrapper to make explicit use of the wrapper. aide is now
    compiled to use a non-existing directory and a non-existing
    configuration file by default, which will lead to an error message
    if invoked parameterless. This is a feature designed to avoid
    accidental tampering with the Debian databases.

    The advantage of this change is that /usr/bin/aide now behaves
    exactly as upstream AIDE again, removing Debian specialties for
    people who are not accustomed to the Debian configuration. If you
    use AIDE in a special way, with your own configuration and your
    own database directory, you'll likely have to change your
    procedures.

aide (0.11a-3) unstable; urgency=low

    Starting with aide 0.11a-2, aide's default configuration has been
    changed. Previously, AIDE did only superficial checks of the
    static parts of the file system. Now, the entire file system is
    included, and the changing parts of the file system are excluded
    from the check. We are changing from a "forbid all possibly
    dangerous changes" stance to a "allow only changes that we know
    are harmless" stance.

    Please note that this might significantly increase aide's
    execution times as we now check the whole file system by default.
    On systems with big, changing file systems (like shell servers or
    big ftp or web servers), you might want to exclude parts of the
    file system to bring execution times down to an acceptable level.
    This is not done in the default configuration since AIDE aims for
    maximum security by default, and big data directories are a
    preferred target for crackers to place their root kit binaries. An
    example rule file to exclude home directories of users with uid >=
    1000 is included in the package and might be put into use at the
    local admin's discretion.

    To allow better updateability, a split configuration scheme has
    been introduced with aide 0.10-5, which is now being put into use
    for the default configuration. /etc/aide.conf is reduced to
    default definitions, while the real work is being done in the
    configuration snippets in /etc/aide/aide.conf.d.

    The contents of /etc/aide/aide.conf.d has already been split to
    reflect which package contains the files that change too
    frequently to be part of a regular check. This allows moving these
    configuration snippets into the respective packages at a later
    time.

    You might want to accept all conffile changes that are offered
    with this update, or otherwise your AIDE will most probably stop
    working.

    The new rule sets in 0.11a-2 have been extensively tested on my
    productive systems. However, since my productive systems are all
    reasonably similar, the new rule sets may not be fully suitable
    for other people's systems. Please do not hesitate to file bugs
    against aide if your AIDE reports include excessive changes that
    should not be flagged as such. Don't forget to include
    configuration and report snippets that might help in devising the
    new rules. These bugs will be usertagged in the BTS with
    "2006-04-configuration" for aide@packages.debian.org.

    Chances are that you don't have all packages installed that are
    taken care of by AIDE's default configuration. That way, you might
    end up excluding more parts of the namespace than you would need
    for your system, but the AIDE protection is still working on a
    broader basis than it did with the old configuration. If you are
    paranoid, you might want to either delete the config snippets you
    don't use (ucf should notice that and not re-install the files on
    update) or create your own conf.d directory (like
    /etc/aide/aide.conf.local.d), symlink the snippets you want in
    there and point aide towards the new conf.d directory by setting
    UPAC_CONFD in /etc/default/aide. This last option is the way I
    have chosen for my personal systems.

    Package maintainers, if you intend to deliver your own aide.conf.d
    snippet in your package, please put your package name after the
    number (31_aide_foo => 31_foo_something) to avoid a namespace
    clash and file a bug against aide so indicate that aide can remove
    its config snippet. It does not hurt to have both installed, so
    there is no need to coordinate.

    The source package can optionally build a package aide-config-zg2,
    which contains rules that are probably only suitable on my
    systems. Of course, building of aide-config-zg2 is disabled by
    default.
